# Pi-Solar
This is a quick install to allow a Rasperry Pi Zero W(adn upwards) to display the current energy production of your Solar Panel stored in your Influxdb.

In this case, I used a 3.5" GPIO Display.
The method how you gather your data and store them in your influxdb is up to you.

You just need to fill up the neccessary information such as, ip-address of your influxdb, the token, the filters and you can start displaying your information live on this screen.
